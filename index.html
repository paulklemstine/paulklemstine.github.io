                Paul Klemstine is a maker and outdoor enthusiast with a passion for technology, innovation, and adrenaline. He was the driving force behind the <a href="https://appletonmakerspace.org/" target="_blank">Appleton Makerspace</a>, serving as its President and founder. This community workshop provides members with access to tools, resources, and a collaborative environment to bring their projects to life.
            </p>

            <p>
                While his legacy with the Makerspace speaks to his dedication to fostering creativity and learning, Paul has since shifted his focus to the thrilling world of watersports.  Now based in Menasha, Wisconsin, he can be found harnessing the power of the wind on Lake Winnebago as a dedicated kite skater and wingfoiler.  But his love for gliding doesn't stop on the water.  Paul is also an avid free skater, finding joy in the freedom and fluidity of movement this activity provides.
            </p>

            <p>
                This unique blend of technological expertise and a love for outdoor adventure paints a picture of Paul as a dynamic individual driven by a desire to create, explore, and push boundaries. He embodies the spirit of a modern-day Renaissance man, seamlessly merging his passion for technology with a zest for life and the outdoors.
